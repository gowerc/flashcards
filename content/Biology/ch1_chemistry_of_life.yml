LIFE01: 
    question:
        - With regards to atoms, what is the Atomic number?
    answer: 
        - The number of protons in an atom.
        - |
            This is what defines is primary characterises and thus what the atom 
            is named after, all atoms with 6 protons are classed as Carbon

LIFE02:
    question:
        -  With regards to atoms, what is the Atomic mass number?
    answer: 
        - The number of protons + the number of neutrons.  The "rule of thumb" atomic mass

LIFE03:
    question:
        - With regards to atoms, what is the Atomic mass?
    answer: 
        - |
            The actual atomic mass which is very close but not exactly equal to the 
            atomic mass number

LIFE04:
    question:
        - With regards to atoms, Relative atomic mass?
    answer: 
        - |
            The atomic mass of an element averaged across all of its isotopes 
            by the relative frequency of which they are found on earth


LIFE05:
    question:
        - What is an Ion ?
    answer: 
        - An Ion is a charged particle / atom

LIFE06:
    question:
        - What is an Isotope?
    answer: 
        - An isotope is the same element but with a different number of neutrons. 
        - |
            Carbon-12  is carbon with 6 protons & 6 neutrons whilst Carbon-14 is 
            carbon with 6 protons and 8 neutrons. 



LIFE07:
    question:
        - Which regards to atoms, what are the Principle energy levels?
    answer: 
        - Are the different  shells / states / rings in which electrons exist around an atom. 
        - Typically each level can contain 2*(n^2) elections. They are filled up from the inside out.


LIFE08:
    question:
        - Which regards to atoms, what is the valence level?
    answer: 
        - The outermost principle energy level to be populated.  Typically only contains up to 8 electrons



LIFE09:
    question:
        - Which regards to atoms, what is the valence electrons?
    answer: 
        - The electrons within the valence level


LIFE10:
    question:
        - Which regards to atoms, what is a Lewis diagram?
    answer: 
        - A way of drawing and connecting atoms within a molecule by writing down their elemental symbol 
        - with a dot for each valence electron and a dash for pairs of shared electrons.


LIFE11:
    question:
        - Which regards to atoms, Octet Rule?
    answer: 
        - | 
            The general rule that atoms want to fill up  (or lose electrons) their outer shell 
            in order to have 8 electrons in it in order to be "stable". Atoms with either 1 or 7 electrons tend to be quite destructive



LIFE12:
    question:
        - What's the difference between a molecule and a compound?
    answer:
        - Molecules - The binding of 2 or more elements either the same or different  e.g.  O2 (same)  or H2O (different)
        - Compounds - The binding of 2 or more different elements (e.g.  H2O)
        - Thus all compounds are molecules  but not all molecules are compounds


LIFE13:
    question:
        - With regards to atoms, what is a covalent bond?
    answer:
        - Where atoms bind together by sharing an electron



LIFE14:
    question:
        - With regards to atoms, what is a Polar Covalent Bond?
    answer:
        - |
            Where atoms bind together by sharing an electron but the electron spends more 
            time with one atom than the other thus resulting in a difference in charge


LIFE15:
    question:
        - With regards to atoms, what is a Coordinate Bond?
    answer:
        - |
            A bond formed between 2 atoms sharing electrons however both of the shared 
            electrons came from only one of the atoms (as opposed to covalent bond where each 
            atom provides one each) 



LIFE16:
    question:
        - With regards to atoms, what is a Ionic Bond?
    answer:
        - Where atoms bind together based upon their difference in charge. 
        - Occurs when atoms give up electrons entirely to another atom  for example salt = sodium  (1 valence electron) + chloride (7 valence electrons)



LIFE17:
    question:
        - With regards to atoms, what is a Hydrogen Bond?
    answer:
        - |
            Occurs because hydrogen tends to form polar covalent bonds leaving part of the molecule negatively charged and 
            the other part positively charged,  thus molecule can bind to similar molecules due to the difference in charge. 
            (Water being the main example H2O resulting in surface tension)



LIFE18:
    question:
        - With regards to atoms, what is a Metallic Bond?
    answer:
        - TODO



LIFE19:
    question:
        - What is the sub-shell configuration of neon (hint it has 10 electrons.  (both short and long versions)
    answer:
        - "Ne: 1S^2  2S^2  2P^6"
        - or 
        - "Ne: [He] 2S^2 2P^6"


LIFE20:
    question:
        - What is the name of a positively and negatively charged ion.
    answer:
        - Cation and Anion respectively 



LIFE21:
    question:
        - What is Electronegativity and how is it measured
    answer:
        - Its an atoms ability to hog electrons within a bond and its measured on the Pauling scale


LIFE22:
    question:
        - What are intermolecular forces and what are the two main types
    answer:
        - |
            Forces that occur between molecules.
            Dipole - Dipole interactions - Due to electronegativity parts of a molecule are positive, 
            others negative. Unlike forces attract holding it together (a Hydrogen bond is the most extreme version of this)
        - |
            London dispersion forces - due to random movements of electrons there are moments when one side is 
            negative and another is positive thus forming a very weak bond between molecules



LIFE23:
    question:
        - Define the law of conservation of matter and the equilibrium constant ( in context of chemical reactions)
    answer:
        - That no atoms are created or destroyed during a reaction, it must always balance.
        - |
            That in a reversible reaction there is a equilibrium value
            which the reaction will tend towards, adding more of the reactant will mean its 
            converted into the product until this point is reached.
