WAB01:
    question:
        - With regards to water, define Hydrophilic
    answer:
        - | 
            Where a substance is charged and has a strong enough force to where water 
            molecules are more attracted to it than other water molecules. This is what 
            causes substances to become dissolved into water.


WAB02:
    question:
        - With regards to water, define Hydrophobic
    answer:
        - |
            Where a substance lacks enough charge to break the hydrogen bond of water and 
            thus the water molecules stick more together than to the substance. This ends 
            up forcing the substance to stay together and be pushed away from the water 
            (for example oil) 


WAB03:
    question:
        - With regards to water, define solvent
    answer:
        - A substance that can dissolve other substances


WAB04:
    question:
        - With regards to water, define solute
    answer:
        - A substance which is dissolved within a substance


WAB05:
    question:
        - With regards to water, define solutions
    answer:
        - |
            A homogenous mixture of a solvent and a solute. A solution of water is also 
            know as an aqueous solution


WAB06:
    question:
        - With regards to water, define hydration shell
    answer:
        - |
            Where water molecules cling to a hydrophilic substance forming a shell around it, 
            these shells then repel each other which is what causes the solute molecules to 
            be evenly dispersed across the solution.


WAB07:
    question:
        - With regards to water, define Dissociation
    answer:
        - The process in which a molecule breaks apart to form individual ions


WAB08:
    question:
        - Name 3 key properties of water
    answer:
        - The universal solvent due to the hydrogen bond making it the primary solution for most reactions required for life
        - The hydrogen bond resulting in cohesion and adhesive forces giving way to capillary action
        - Its high specific heat and heat vaporisation as well as it being less dense than its solid form ice


WAB09:
    question:
        - With regards to water, define Cohesion
    answer:
        - The force of attraction between 2 identical atoms/molecules (in the case of water caused by the hydrogen bond)


WAB10:
    question:
        - With regards to water, define Adhesion
    answer:
        - | 
            The force of attraction between 2 different atoms/molecules. 
            In the case of water the adhesion force with glass is stronger than 
            waters cohesive force.



WAB11:
    question:
        - With regards to water, define Capillary Action
    answer:
        - | 
            The ability for water to rise up a surface due to its adhesion to that surface 
            until a point where the cohesive force + gravity balance out.




WAB12:
    question:
        - What is specific heat,  what is the name for the specific heat of water?
    answer:
        - | 
            Specific heat is the amount of energy required to raise 1g of a substance by 
            1 degree Celsius.  Water due to its hydrogen bond has a high specific heat 
            and this value has even been given its own special name of a "calorie"



WAB13:
    question:
        -  With regards to water, describe the process of autoionization 
    answer:
        - | 
            It is where 2 water molecules (h2o) bump into each other in such a way that 1 
            steals the hydrogen proton from another but leaves behind the corresponding 
            electron of that hydrogen (as oxygen has a very high electronegativity).  
            Thus resulting in hydronium and hydroxide.  I.e. it increases the amount of 
            free hydrogen ions.


WAB14:
    question:
        - What is the Arrhenius and Bronsted-Lowry definitions of Acids and Bases
    answer:
        - Arrhenius
        - Acid = A molecule that when put in a aqueous solution increases the concentration of hydrogen ions
        - Base = A molecule that when put in an aqueous solution increases the concentration of Hydroxide [OH] ions
        - Bronsted-Lowry
        - Acid = A molecule that likes to donate hydrogen ions
        - Base = A molecule that likes to receive hydrogen ions
        




WAB15:
    question:
        - Define a Conjugate acid and a Conjugate base 
    answer:
        - |
            A conjugate acid, within the Bronsted–Lowry acid–base theory, is a chemical 
            compound formed by the reception of a proton (H+) by a base—in other words, 
            it is a base with a hydrogen ion added to it, as in the reverse reaction it 
            loses a hydrogen ion. On the other hand, a conjugate base is what is left over 
            after an acid has donated a proton during a chemical reaction.
            Hence, a conjugate base is a species formed by the removal of a proton from an
            acid, as in the reverse reaction it is able to gain a hydrogen ion.
        - Acid + Base  <->  Conjugate Base + Conjugate Acid




WAB16:
    question:
        - What is a mole & pH
    answer:
        - |
            a mole is just a constant number used because the number of atoms in a given quantity 
            is typically very large. For reference 1 mole = 6.02214076 × 10^23   atom. 
        - |
            pH - Let C be the number of loose hydrogen ions in a given solution (which would become)
            hydrogen + hydroxide in water). Then pH = - log(C) (log to the base 10)
        - |
            For water the number of hydroxide molecules  is 1 x 10 ^-7  thus giving a pH of 7.
            pH  < 7 is considered acidic,  pH > 7 is considered basic or alkali




WAB017:
    question:
        - With regards to pH, what is a buffer ? 
    answer:
        - |
            Wiki = A buffer solution (more precisely, pH buffer or hydrogen ion buffer) is an 
            aqueous solution consisting of a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base, or 
            vice versa. Its pH changes very little when a small amount of strong acid or base 
            is added to it. Buffer solutions are used as a means of keeping pH at a nearly 
            constant value in a wide variety of chemical applications. In nature, there are 
            many systems that use buffering for pH regulation. For example, the bicarbonate 
            buffering system is used to regulate the pH of blood.
        - | 
            A reversible reaction between a acid / base and its corresponding conjugate acid/base 
            such that a constant pH is maintained as if the pH is raised or lowered the reaction 
            will occur until it reaches its equilibrium point again.
