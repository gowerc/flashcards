CARB01:
    question:
        - What is a hydrocarbon, what is a organic molecule
    answer:
        - |
            A hydrocarbon is a molecule consisting of just hydrogen and carbon.  An organic molecule 
            is any molecule consisting of carbon. 




CARB02:
    question:
        - What molecule is CH3^CH3 (using line angle notation)
    answer:
        - |
            Propane C3H8   each unfilled node of a ^  is a Carbon and unless otherwise stated its 
            valence electrons are filled by hydrogens.  This means here the un-specified point is 
            filled with a  CH2




CARB03:
    question:
        - What do the different hydrocarbon suffixes represent i.e. ethene, ethane & ethyne
    answer:
        -  |
            The suffix represents the largest bond type (-ane = single, -ene = double, -yne = tripper).  
            Note that double bonds are rigid and are unable to rotate and a triple bond means the (section) 
            of a molecule forms a linear line. 




CARB04:
    question:
        - What do the different hydrocarbon prefixes represent i.e. Propane, Methane & Ethane
    answer:
        - The prefix represents the number of carbon present in the molecule. 



CARB05:
    question:
        - What is an Isomer
    answer:
        - |
            Isomers are 2 molecules that have the same chemical formula but are otherwise different 
            (i.e. different structures or different orientations)



CARB06:
    question:
        - What is the difference between a structural isomer and a stereoisomer
    answer:
        - |
            A structural isomer is an isomer due to a different structure or atomic arrangement 
            (i.e. atoms are connected in different places).  A stereoisomer  are molecules that 
            have the same fundamental structure but may be oriented differently (i.e. components 
            stick out in different directions after a double bond or 2 atoms are on opposite sides 
            of the molecule and can't be rotated or super imposed onto each other)




CARB07:
    question:
        - What is a functional group
    answer:
        - |
            Functional groups typically occur in organic chemistry where a hydrocarbon has 
            another "bit" attached to it. This "other bit" tend to take common patterns which 
            we categorise into functional groups.  For example  R-O-H is known as a hydroxyl 
            group.   These functional groups have similar chemical properties and affect things 
            such as the acidity as well as providing charge and the ability to dissolve in water. 



CARB08:
    question:
        - What is an amino acid  and what is a alcohol
    answer:
        - |
            Amino acids are hydrocarbon chains with an amino group and a carboxyl group attached.   
            Alcohols are hydrocarbon chains with a single hydroxyl group attached.  The most common
            alcohol we consume is ethanol which is a 2 carbon hydrocarbon with a hydroxyl group on the end.
