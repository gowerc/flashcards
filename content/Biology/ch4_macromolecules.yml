MACRO01:
    question:
        - What are the 4 main macro molecule groups?
    answer:
        - Carbohydrates
        - Lipids
        - Proteins
        - Nucleic Acids




MACROCARB:
    question:
        - Describe the purpose of carbohydrates
    answer:
        - |
            Are broken down into glucose before entering the blood stream where it used to produce ATP 
            which is used to power a variety of metabolic processes. Excess carbohydrates are stored as glycogen which is stored
            in the live and muscles. Excess glycogen is stored as fat.


MACROLIPID:
    question:
        - Describe the purpose of Lipids
    answer:
        - |
            Lipids are a group of molecules defined roughly by their shared property of being hydrophobic  
            (However some lipids are amphipathic ("am"-"fee"-"pafic") meaning 1 end is hydrophilic 
            whist the other is hydrophobic). The primary purpose of lipids are: 
        - Storage of energy for long-term use (e.g. triglycerides)
        - Hormonal roles (e.g. steroids such as oestrogen and testosterone)
        - Insulation – both thermal (triglycerides) and electrical (sphingolipids)
        - Protection of internal organs (e.g. triglycerides and waxes)
        - Structural components of cells (e.g. phospholipids and cholesterol)



MACROPROT:
    question:
        - Describe the purpose of Proteins
    answer:
        - |
            Play many critical roles in the body. They do most of the work in cells and are required 
            for the structure, function,and regulation of the body’s tissues and organs.  Examples of their function include:
        - Antibody - Antibodies bind to specific foreign particles, such as viruses and bacteria, to help protect the body.
        - Enzyme - Enzymes carry out almost all of the thousands of chemical reactions that take place in cells. They also assist with the formation of new molecules by reading the genetic information stored in DNA.
        - Messenger - Messenger proteins, such as some types of hormones, transmit signals to coordinate biological processes between different cells, tissues, and organs.
        - Structural component - These proteins provide structure and support for cells. On a larger scale, they also allow the body to move.
        - Transport/storage - These proteins bind and carry atoms and small molecules within cells and throughout the body.



MACRONUC:
    question:
        - Describe the purpose of Nucleic Acids
    answer:
        - Found within all cells and viruses, nucleic acids are used for the storage and expression of genetic information




MACRO02:
    question:
        - What is a monomer and a polymer? Give an example with respect to sugars
    answer:
        -  |
            A polymer is a repeated chain of a monomer where the monomer can be thought of as a single 
            building block.  Glucose is an example of a monomer which is used to construct long 
            polysaccharides. Maltose is formed of 2 glucose monomers and is known as a disaccharide  




MACRO03:
    question:
        - What does synthesis means ?  What is dehydration synthesis? What is Hydrolysis ?
    answer:
        - Synthesis is the creation of a new compound from the reaction of 2 (or more) simpler compounds or molecules. 
        - |
            Dehydration synthesis is the process of joining two molecules, or compounds, together following 
            the removal of water. As an example Glucose monomers are joined together via dehydration synthesis (each time losing a 
            water molecule) to form more complex sugars such as maltose and cellulose.  
        - |
            Hydrolysis means "water"&"breaking down"; it is the process of breaking down complex compounds 
            into simpler compounds by adding water 


 
MACRO04:
    question: 
        - What term is used to mean single / two  / many sugars?  Give an 3 examples for each? 

    answer:
        - | 
            Monosaccharide (also known as simple sugars)
            Purpose -  Used as an Energy source including 
            Examples - glucose, fructose & galactose
        - |
            Disaccharide 
            Purpose -  Used for transport
            Examples - lactose (glucose + galactose), maltose (glucose *2) and sucrose aka table sugar (glucose + fructose) 
        - |
            Polysaccharides  
            Purpose -  Used for storage
            Examples - cellulose, glycogen, starch
 
 

  
MACRO07:
    question:
        - Describe the structure of Glucose, how does it relate to fructose and galactose. 
    answer:
        - Chemical formula =  c6 H12 06 
        - First carbon has double bond to Oxygen (carbonyl) all the others are bonded to other carbons + hydrogen's 
        - Most commonly found in a ring where the fifth carbon bonds to the oxygen of the first carbon 
        - fructose is a structural isomer where the double bonded oxygen is on the second carbon 
        - galactose is a stereoisomer (identical but orientated different) 



  
MACRO08:
    question:
        - What is Triacylglycerol,  explain the different parts of this term and what they mean. 

    answer:
        - Also known as fat or Triglycerides,  a type of lipid 
        - | 
            It is 3 fatty acids ( long hydrocarbon chains that end in a carbonyl group) that joined 
            onto a glycerol molecule back bone ( C3 H8 O3) via dehydration synthesis 
        - | 
            The joining points have a Acyl functional group thus "tri" = 3 , "acyl" = the functional group , 
            "glycerol" = The molecule that binds them together.  




 
  
MACRO09:
    question:
        - What are the 4 types triglycerides and what are the differences between them 
    answer:
        - Saturated - no double bonds in any of the hydrocarbon chain, are typically solid at room temperature  i.e. butter 
        - Unsaturated or Mono-unsaturated  - Where there is a single double bond with a cis isomer which causes a kink. typically liquid at room temperature e.g. oils 
        - Polyunsaturated - Where there are multiple double bonds with cis isomers causing kinks. Almost always found as liquids 
        - Trans - Where there are many double bonds but they are all trans isomers meaning there are no kinks. These do not occur in nature and have can have significant health complications 

 


MACRO10:
    question:
        - What is the tell-tale sign of a steroid? What are steroids used for? 
    answer:
        - | 
            Most steroids consist of 17 carbons formed to make 3 rings of 6 carbons and a 4th ring 
            made of just 5 carbons (with 2 carbons being shared between each ring i.e 6 + 4 + 4 + 3 = 17). 
            What differentiates between steroids is what additional stuff is bolted onto them. 
        - |
            Steroids are typically used as long distance signals used to control physiological 
            processes such as growth , metabolism and reproduction (some steroids are lipid based 
            whilst others are protein based, known as peptide hormones) 

 

 

 
MACRO11:
    question:
        - What does DNA stand for? 
        - What are the 5 different bases and how do they pair up? 
        - What force holds the bases together?
        - What is a nucleotide?
    answer:
        - Deoxyribonucleic acid  - A sugar (deoxyribose) with a phosphate group (acidic) backbone (the D and A) located within the nucleus of cells (the N)
        - | 
            The possible basis and their pairings are: <br/>
            - Adenine - Thymine<br/>
            - Guanine - Cytosine<br/>
            - Adenine - Uracil
        - The bases are held together by hydrogen bonding. 
        - A nucleotide is a complete set of the a sugar with a phosphate group + a nitrogenous base

 

MACRO12:
    question:
        - What is the relationship between DNA, Chromosomes, Genes and RNA
    answer:
        - |
            DNA is the generic structure for carrying genetic information.
            Formed as a phosphate + sugar backbone in a double helix with the genetic information
            stored in the bases connecting the double helix
        - |
            Chromosomes are structures formed by compacting large amounts of DNA together. We have 46 
            Chromosomes in each cell formed as 23 pairs with one set coming from each parent
        - Genes are a specific section of DNA that is used to code a specific protein
        - RNA is a single helix structure (similar to DNA) which uses ribose as its sugar backbone


MACRO13:
    question:
        - What is meant by DNA having a Anti-parallel structure?
        - How do we denote the direction of DNA? 
        - What do these numbers represent?
    answer:
        - The orientation of DNA is denoted by the direction of the carbon atoms within the sugar backbone
        - The sugar connects to the phosphate group at its 3' and 5' carbon.
        - The two sides of the double helix will always be in the opposite direction with one being 3'-5' and the other 5'-3' (thus anti-parallel)



MACRO14:
    question:
        - Briefly describe the components of the "Central Dogma" of molecular biology
    answer:
        - DNA - Stores all our genetic information
        - Ribosomes - Molecular machines that read mRNA in order to create proteins
        - mRNA - Messenger RNA - Binds to DNA and brings the information to the ribosomes
        - tRNA - Transfer RNA - Used to bring amino acids to the ribosomes
        - rRNA - Ribosomal RNA - Structural components of the Ribosomes
        - miRNA - Micro RNA - Act as gene regulators



MACRO15:
    question:
        - With regards to the "Central Dogma" of molecular biology what is
        - Replication
        - Transcription
        - Translation
    answer:
        - Replication - Where DNA makes a copy of itself by splitting the apart the double helix and combining with copies of the missing basis
        - Transcription - Where messenger RNA (mRNA) is created which is used to take genetic information outside of the nucleus
        - Translation - The process of using mRNA to create amino acids (each 3 letter sequence forms a codon which binds to one of the 20 amino acids)
