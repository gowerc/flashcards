MACRO01:
    question:
        - What are the 4 main macro molecule groups and what is their purpose? 
    answer:
        - Carbohydrates  ( TODO ) 
        - Lipids (fats)   ( TODO ) 
        - Proteins   ( TODO ) 
        - nucleic acids    ( TODO ) 


 MACRO02:
    question:
        - What is a monomer and a polymer? Give an example with respect to sugars
    answer:
        -  |
            A polymer is a repeated chain of a monomer where the monomer can be thought of as a single 
            building block.  Glucose is an example of a monomer which is used to construct long 
            polysaccharides. 
            Maltose is formed of 2 glucose monomers and is known as a disaccharide  




 MACRO04:
    question:
        - What does synthesis means ?  What is dehydration synthesis? What is Hydrolysis ?
    answer:
        - Synthesis is the creation of a new compound from the reaction of 2 (or more) simpler compounds or molecules. 
        - |
            Dehydration synthesis is the process of joining two molecules, or compounds, together following 
            the removal of water. As an example Glucose monomers are joined together via dehydration synthesis 
            (each time losing a water molecule) to form more complex sugars such as maltose and cellulose.  
        - |
            Hydrolysis means "water" & "breaking down"; it is the process of breaking down complex compounds 
            into simpler compounds by adding water
