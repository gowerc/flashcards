MACRO01:
    question:
        - What are the 4 main macro molecule groups and what is their purpose? 
    answer:
        - Carbohydrates  ( TODO ) 
        - Lipids (fats)   ( TODO ) 
        - Proteins   ( TODO ) 
        - nucleic acids    ( TODO ) 


MACRO02:
    question:
        - What is a monomer and a polymer? Give an example with respect to sugars
    answer:
        -  |
            A polymer is a repeated chain of a monomer where the monomer can be thought of as a single 
            building block.  Glucose is an example of a monomer which is used to construct long 
            polysaccharides. Maltose is formed of 2 glucose monomers and is known as a disaccharide  




MACRO03:
    question:
        - What does synthesis means ?  What is dehydration synthesis? What is Hydrolysis ?
    answer:
        - Synthesis is the creation of a new compound from the reaction of 2 (or more) simpler compounds or molecules. 
        - |
            Dehydration synthesis is the process of joining two molecules, or compounds, together following 
            the removal of water. As an example Glucose monomers are joined together via dehydration synthesis (each time losing a 
            water molecule) to form more complex sugars such as maltose and cellulose.  
        - |
            Hydrolysis means "water"&"breaking down"; it is the process of breaking down complex compounds 
            into simpler compounds by adding water 


 
MACRO04:
    question: 
        - What term is used to mean single / two  / many sugars?  What is fructose, starch  and lactose? 

    answer:
        - monosaccharide (also known as simple sugars including glucose, fructose & galactose )
        - disaccharide (lactose = glucose + galactose, maltose = glucose *2 and sucrose (table sugar) =  glucose + fructose)  
        - polysaccharides ( e.g. cellulose, starch, glucagon). 
 


 
 
MACRO05:
    question:
        - What is the main purpose of carbohydrates? 
    answer:
        - | 
            Simple sugars are used as a source of energy by our cells whilst complex 
            sugars are used for wide array of tasks such energy storage, shells on insects 
            and the cell wall in plants (which is what gives them their rigid structure) 

 
 

  
MACRO06:
    question:
        - What are lipids? What are they used for? 
    answer:
        - |
            Lipids are a group of molecules defined roughly by their shared property of being hydrophobic  
            (However some lipids are amphipathic ("am"-"fee"-"pafic") meaning 1 end is hydrophilic 
            whist the other is hydrophobic). 
            The primary purpose of lipids is to: 
        - store energy 
        - provide insulation 
        - make cell membranes 
        - form water repellent layers on leaves 
        - provide the building blocks for hormones 

 

  
MACRO07:
    question:
        - Describe the structure of Glucose, how does it relate to fructose and galactose. 
    answer:
        - Chemical formula =  c6 H12 06 
        - First carbon has double bond to Oxygen (carbonyl) all the others are bonded to other carbons + hydrogens 
        - Most commonly found in a ring where the fifth carbon bonds to the oxygen of the first carbon 
        - fructose is a structural isomer where the double bonded oxygen is on the second carbon 
        - galactose is a stereoisomer (identical but orientated different) 



  
MACRO08:
    question:
        - What is Triacylglycerol,  explain the different parts of this term and what they mean. 

    answer:
        - Also known as fat or Triglycerides,  a type of lipid 
        - | 
            It is 3 fatty acids ( long hydrocarbon chains that end in a carboxyl group) that joined 
            onto a glycerol molecule back bone ( C3 H8 O3) via dehydration synthesis 
        - | 
            The joining points have a Acyl functional group thus "tri" = 3 , "acyl" = the functional group , 
            "glycerol" = The molecule that binds them together.  




 
  
MACRO09:
    question:
        - What are the 4 types triglycerides and what are the differences between them 
    answer:
        - Saturated - no double bonds in any of the hydrocarbon chain, are typically solid at room temperature  i.e. butter 
        - Unsaturated or Mono-unsaturated  - Where there is a single double bond with a cis isomer which causes a kink. typically liquid at room temperature e.g. oils 
        - Polyunsaturated - Where there are multiple double bonds with cis isomers causing kinks. Almost always found as liquids 
        - Trans - Where there are many double bonds but they are all trans isomers meaning there are no kinks. These do not occur in nature and have can have significant health complications 

 


MACRO10:
    question:
        - What is the tell-tale sign of a steroid? What are steroids used for? 
    answer:
        - | 
            Most steroids consist of 17 carbons formed to make 3 rings of 6 carbons and a 4th ring 
            made of just 5 carbons (with 2 carbons being shared between each ring i.e 6 + 4 + 4 + 3 = 17). 
            What differentiates between steroids is what additional stuff is bolted onto them. 
        - |
            Steroids are typically used as long distance signals used to control physiological 
            processes such as growth , metabolism and reproduction (some steroids are lipid based 
            whilst others are protein based, known as peptide hormones)
